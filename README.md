# Leaderboard

> This is a Leaderboard  project setup using webpack and ES6 modules. I haveve built a basic frontend with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to post and get data from the API https://us-central1-js-capstone-backend.cloudfunctions.net/api/ where I first created a game through Postman and after created a basic UI that with asynchronous code sends a POST request through the submit button of the "Add your score" form, and sends a GET request through the "refresh" button in the recent scores table.
